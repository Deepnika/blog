Hello and Welcome! I am someone who likes to ask questions about astronomy and physics and then tries to find their answers. I like to read scientific papers, old journals and history of astronomy and post about my readings on this blog. I hope you enjoy reading them. If you want to send me a message, drop me a line at

I have a very hard time asking people to read my blog, probably because I just started this fray and I think I’m not very good at it. I appreciate any positive criticism that comes my way. Since this page has to be something about me, let’s see - I am a slow reader and I obviously like reading, I like to keep myself occupied with a lot of things like sketching, playing the violin, cooking etc. - even though I suck at all of it, and I am a nervous wreck whenever I am with an unfamiliar group of people. Those are my most serious shortcomings. And for the good part - I guess I am just naturally curious about everything.
