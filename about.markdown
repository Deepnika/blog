It's been a long time since I wanted to experience the most sublime and powerful art of all - writing. I wasn't very confident about the idea that my writings, being a speck of HTML and Sass would do much in this virtual world full of the indefinite oo..os on Google. I anyway created this blog because it allows me to give something positive back to this world from which I have taken so much. This is just an attempt to put my own words out there and hope that they make you a little happier. And they say you start out by writing crap and eventually get better at it.

The story goes something like this - I was not satisfied with the number and quality of GitHub repositories I initially had (still not satisfied ughh), so I decided to make this play repository called "blog". I was excited when I came across Jekyll Blogs and Github Pages and immediately set sail on a quest to learn the ways of blogging. I came across great blogs like <a href = "https://everywhereist.com/">The Everywhereist</a> and some others. After reading some of these blogs, I realized that the goal of creating a blog does not have to be as noble as to help people leap over any terminal difficulty they may be facing in their lives, but it is not supposed to be an encyclopedia either. My intention, at the very least is to bring out the happiness embedded in the little ideas this world has seen and share them with you. And if you've still not closed this webpage frustrated with my crappy writing, well, you are a generous soul and I might change your mind very soon.

So, all my life, I've been interested in astronomy.. NO.. scratch that. I mean I was intrigued and annoyed as a child when the sun and the moon followed me everywhere and I couldn't explain why that was happening. I thought maybe when I move fast enough in a car (unaware of the existence of planes), I could lose them. Turns out, I would have to move really fast and really far to get rid of them. However, the point is, the moon, the stars like the sun, and the cosmos as a whole have always been the source of knowledge, wisdom, and curiosity for mankind, and I am above all else, a member of this species. I still remember the enlightenment I felt the first time I learned that the moon was not just a pretty jewel and looking at the stars is like looking back in time. So when I was contemplating what my blog should be about, I had no area other than astronomy where my contracted faculties were enlarged enough to write a blog about. And the other components and flavors to make the journey interesting followed.

The name of your first blog is something very personal, yet "The Spindle of Necessity" exudes no such emotion. It's funny actually why I chose this name. The community of astronomers generally behave petulantly if astronomy is confused with astrology, or if astronomy is referred to be less important than other occupations aimed at surviving, and I'm no different. Not that we have anything against astrology, the two sciences are just very different and aimed at different purposes. And it doesn't help that even the great Sherlock Holmes didn't bother with the solar system.

> When told by Dr. John Watson that the Earth goes around the sun and not the other way around, Holmes remarked - "Now that I know it, I shall do my best to forget it."

I recalled coming across this term once, some time ago and it stuck with me, for good reason. I immediately googled it and there it was from <a href = "https://johnpickard.co.uk/works/programmenotes/spindle-of-necessity/">John Pickard's blog</a>
</p>

> "The Spindle of Necessity was a concept invented by the ancient Greeks. It provided a model of the workings of the universe, with the sun, moon, five planets and fixed stars revolving around the earth (which was then thought to be at the centre of the universe)."

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
After a Eureka! moment, I decided this was it. One of the rare terms related to astronomy that has anything to do with the meaning of "necessary".

I was wrong. Actually, Plato’s book - Republic, concludes with the chapter called - “Myth of Er”. It is interesting to know that the archaic meaning of the word myth is “speech, narrative, fiction or account” which is a little different from the present day meaning of myth in “mythbusters”. The entire account is about the afterlife and immortality of the souls and it is pretty interesting to read, if you have any curiosity for philosophy. This chapter mentions <a href = "https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ananke-Greek-mythology">Ananke</a> who is also known as Goddess Necessity and she is depicted customarily holding a spindle. Perhaps some lines from the book itself would be appropriate at this point.

> …… On the eighth day the souls of the pilgrims resumed their journey, and in four days came to a spot whence they looked down upon a line of light, in colour like a rainbow, only brighter and clearer. One day more brought them to the place, and they saw that this was the column of light which binds together the whole universe. The ends of the column were fastened to heaven, and from them hung the distaff of Necessity, on which all the heavenly bodies turned–the hook and spindle were of adamant, and the whorl of a mixed substance. The whorl was in form like a number of boxes fitting into one another with their edges turned upwards, making together a single whorl which was pierced by the spindle. The outermost had the rim broadest, and the inner whorls were smaller and smaller, and had their rims narrower. The largest (the fixed stars) was spangled–the seventh (the sun) was brightest–the eighth (the moon) shone by the light of the seventh–the second and fifth (Saturn and Mercury) were most like one another and yellower than the eighth–the third (Jupiter) had the whitest light–the fourth (Mars) was red–the sixth (Venus) was in whiteness second. The whole had one motion, but while this was revolving in one direction the seven inner circles were moving in the opposite, with various degrees of swiftness and slowness. The spindle turned on the knees of Necessity, and a Siren stood hymning upon each circle, while Lachesis, Clotho, and Atropos, the daughters of Necessity, sat on thrones at equal intervals, singing of past, present, and future…..

This is obviously a translation as the original text is in greek. It is always interesting to know what the earthlings’ philosophies were in the BCs and how far we have arrived. Have we only gained a lot or did manage to lose a few of the good ideas along the way? What is spoken now, does not necessarily have to be all better than what was spoken then, but we can all agree that the balance has been heavy on the side of improvements. You might have seen this picture before:

There was no picture that Plato left for us to visualize the spindle of necessity, but this picture comes very close to describing it. It shows some of the planets, the Sun and the Moon revolving around the Earth. Aristotle (384-323 BC) was Plato's student for a long time. This was the order of heavenly bodies suggested first by Hipparchus (190-120 BC) and adopted by Aristotle later on. Much later, Ptolemy (100-170 AD) adopted this geocentric model in his famous book - Amalgest. Apart from shaping the philosophical and religious views of the masses, the spindle of necessity depicts the interest of the ancient Greeks in astronomy and how central they considered it to their lives.

At the end, because of the pretty name searching, I got to know some history about this geocentric model and read some of Plato's Republic. I decided to stick with this title from the past.
