<!-- It's been a long time since I wanted to experience the most sublime and powerful art of all - writing. I wasn't very confident about the fact that my writings, being a speck of html and saas would do much in this world full of the indefinite oo's on Google in the virtual world; but I reckoned that is the case with me living as a human being in the real world as well, so what the heck! And they say you start out by writing crap and eventually get better at it.

I was not satisfied with the number and quality of github repositories I initially had (still not satisfied uggh) so I decided to make this play repository called "blog". I was excited when I came across Jekyll Blogs and Github Pages and immediately set sail on a quest to learn the ways of blogging. I came across great blogs like "The Everywhereist" and some others. My goal of creating this blog may not be as noble as to help you leap over any terminal difficulty you may be facing in your life, but it is not supposed to be an encyclopedia either. My intention, at the very least is to bring out the happiness embedded in the little ideas this world has seen and share them with you. And if you've still not closed this webpage frustrated with my crappy writing, well, I might change your mind very soon.

So, all my life, I've been interested in astronomy.. NO.. scratch that. I mean I was intrigued and annoyed as a child when the sun and moon followed me everywhere I went and I couldn't explain why that was happening. I thought maybe when I move fast enough in a car (unaware of the existence of planes) I could lose them. Turns out, I would need to move real fast and real far to get rid of them. However the point is, the moon, the stars like the sun and the cosmos as a whole have always been the source of knowledge, wisdom and curiosity for the mankind, and I am above all else, a member of this specie. I still remember the enlightenment I felt the first time I learned that the moon was not just a pretty jewel and looking at the stars is like looking back in time. So when I was contemplating what my blog should be about, I had no area other than astronomy where my contracted faculties were as enlarged. And the other components and flavors to make the journey interesting, followed.

Now the name of your first blog is something very personal I feel, yet "The Spindle of Necessity" exudes no such emotion. It's funny actually why I chose this name. The community of amateur astronomers will  be very pouty if you confuse astronomy with astrology, or refer to astronomy as being less important than other occupations aimed at surviving, and I'm no different. And it doesn't help that even the great Sherlock Holmes didn't bother with the Solar System. So a few days ago, I recalled coming across this term once, years ago and it stuck with me, and for good reason. I immediately googled it and there it was from `John Pickard's blog`:

> "The Spindle of Necessity was a concept invented by the ancient Greeks. It provided a model of the workings of the universe, with the sun, moon, five planets and fixed stars revolving around the earth (which was then thought to be at the centre of the universe)."

After a Eureka! moment, I decided this was it. The only term related to astronomy that has anything to do with the meaning of "necessary". 

How very lacking I was in the knowledge of greek mythologies. 

Over the years, Greek mythology has been the source of inspiration for many poets and authors. They are tales pertaining to Gods, heroes and dietes. The word "myth" however has an archaic meaning pertaining to "account" or "speech" or "narrative" and that is the sense in which these "mythologies" are to be understood, because people then believed them to be true. While they might be a collection from times unknown, and even the Greeks 

After all this hassle, it seemed too cruel to change the name of this blog to anything else. So there you have it!   -->
